     * Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) :-
     * It states that the larger interfaces split into smaller ones.
     * Because the implementation classes use only the methods that are required.
     * We should not force the client to use the methods that they do not want to use.
     *
     * The goal of the interface segregation principle is similar to the single
     * responsibility principle.
